Labib and Safwan, who are 40 km apart, both begin running towards each other in a straight line at a constant speed of 8 km/h. A mosquito, which was at their midpoint, starts flying at the same time they start and always stays at a speed of 30 km/h. First, it flies to Labib, then to Safwan, then back to Labib, and so on, alternating until Safwan and Labib meet. Find the total distance traveled by the mosquito. | 75 km

A car starts from rest and accelerates uniformly at 6 m/s^2 for 10 seconds. After ten seconds, the magnitude of its acceleration decreases by 4 m/s^2 and it travels in this new constant acceleration for the next 700 metres of its journey. Suddenly, the car begins to decelerate from its maximum speed to a speed of 50 m/s^1 until t=30s. Finally, the magnitude of its deceleration increases by x m/s^2, by which its speed uniformly changes until coming to a stop. What is the shape of the graph of the velocity-time graph plotted for the entire journey of the car? | pentagon
